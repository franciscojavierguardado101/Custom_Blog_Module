This module will create a custom content type for blog posts called 
"Custom Blog" with fields for title, body, author, and publication date. 
The custom_blog.module file implements hook_schema() to define the 
database schema for storing blog post content. The custom_blog.info.yml 
file provides metadata about the module. The custom_blog.install file 
can be used to define any additional database schema changes if needed.
